Tetris Flash
============

Simple Tetris clone made in Flash for my upper secondary school graduation project.

## School project information
This is part of my graduation project for a technical/IT school programme. By building a simple Tetris clone in both HTML5 and Flash, I intend to research the pros and cons of the two major web game platforms. The scope of this assignment is 100 hours, but this game will be kept relatively simple as the primary intent is to research and compare certain criteria such as the performance and browser/device compatibility.
